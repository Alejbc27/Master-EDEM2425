# 🧠 Module 1 – Foundations of Data & Development

This folder contains the materials and exercises from the first module of the Big Data & Cloud Master. The focus of this stage is to build a solid foundation in both technical skills and data understanding, essential for any data engineer or cloud practitioner.

## 📌 What you’ll find here

This module introduces the key tools and concepts needed to work effectively in data-driven environments:

- 🐧**Linux & Git:** Command-line fluency and version control best practices.
