# ☁️ MODULE 3: Cloud Platforms & Infrastructure

This module focused on designing and deploying modern cloud architectures across **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**, **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**, and **Microsoft Azure**, always using **Terraform** to ensure automation, reproducibility, and infrastructure as code.

The goal was to build cloud-native data platforms using serverless services, scalable compute, and automated CI/CD pipelines — all while applying cost-efficient and production-ready best practices.

## ✅ What I Learned

🌐 **Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**  
Worked with services like BigQuery, Pub/Sub, Cloud Run, Cloud Functions, Dataflow, and Firestore.  
Deployed full infrastructure using Terraform, focusing on modular design and automation.

🌩️ **Amazon Web Services (AWS)**  
Built data pipelines using EC2, S3, Redshift, RDS, Glue, and Apache Iceberg.  
Used Terraform to provision and manage resources and integrate data workflows.

🟦 **Microsoft Azure**  
Explored Event Hubs for real-time messaging, Data Factory for ETL orchestration, and deployed containerized services via Azure Container Apps and Azure Functions.  
All infrastructure and services were deployed using Terraform.

🛠️ **Terraform**  
Used extensively across all platforms to write infrastructure as code (IaC).  
Focused on reusability, modularization, and consistency in multi-cloud deployments.

🤖 **GitHub Actions**  
Set up CI/CD pipelines to automate infrastructure provisioning and service deployment.
